This app is like a story where you get to make choices. The story changes based on the choices you make, kind of like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book

Yuba is torn between two paths: accepting a university offer abroad or taking a local job to support his family.
If he goes abroad, he faces loneliness and pressure but achieves financial success. 
If he stays home, he struggles with lower pay, watching his friends thrive elsewhere. 
As he invests in the family business, progress is slow, and he questions if he made the right choice. 
Eventually, if he returns abroad, the financial success feels hollow as he grows disconnected from his family. 
The story explores the emotional weight of choosing between personal ambition and family responsibility.
